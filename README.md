## 💡 Try It Now!

**I made this because i think too many websites ask for money or signup/login to do any sort of analysis on your text. I am a college student and i just want a quick overlook of my text and not jump through hoops. So, yeah, i don't have a PayPal enbaled here or anything. This website will not ask for money or make you click any links. I am responsible for the text analysis only. If anything of this sort pops up - reload the page please and contact me.**

Is this as good as the paid, premium versions of similar apps? 
 - No but it's free and works pretty quickly for meduim-sized texts

At the moment, the tool analyzes texts in English. Support for additional languages is planned.
